Range of Motion (ROM) testing - Due to restrictions demonstrated in the cervical and/or lumbar spine, active
range of motion testing procedures were performed today using the ZERO-NEUTRAL, GRAVITY-BASED SFTR
(Sagittal Frontal Transverse Rotation) Method from the AMA Guidelines to the Evaluation of Permanent
Impairment, Fifth Ed., 2001. These restrictions are ratable impairments set by the AMA Guides to the
Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 5th Ed., 2001. The individual test measurements and their calculated
impairments are objective tests that will be repeated periodically to demonstrate/monitor progress or lack there
of and to help us determine if there is permanent loss of function. Today's examination revealed the following
findings:
Musculoskeletal - Range of Motion - Cervical - Active
-Flexion:
25/60 degrees with pain, stiffness and radiation
-Extension:

Testing revealed a decrease in normal bilateral muscle strength indicative of subluxation based neurological
dysfunction. The areas that tested weak during the examination include; neck flexors, neck extensors, neck
lateral flexors, shoulder abductors, shoulder extensors, shoulder flexors, shoulder lateral rotators, shoulder
medial rotators, hip flexors, hip abductors, hip adductors, hip extensors, hip lateral rotators and hip medial
rotators.
The following extremity or more were found to be restricted with pain: Right shoulder, Left hip and Right hip
Physical Findings:
- Lymphatics: Palpation of the lymph nodes in the neck, bilateral axilla, groin and/or other locations revealed
grossly normal findings. No evidence of tenderness, swelling or enlarged palpable tissue. Otherwise
unremarkable findings.
- Skin: full body (arms, legs, trunk and head/neck), head/neck and trunk: grossly normal, dry warm, without
diaphoresis, depigmentation or hyperpigmentation. No rashes, ulcers, or ecchymosis. No purple striae, no
excessive hair or acne. Otherwise unremarkable findings.
- Head, Neck, Eyes, Ears and Throat: normocephalic, atraumatic head, normal sclera, no conjunctival
injection or pallor, no stare, no lid lag. Pupils PERLA. Otherwise unremarkable findings.
The patient tested positive for myalgia/myositis in the following regions right cervical, right cervical dorsal, right
clavicular, right anterior shoulder, right chest, right posterior shoulder and right mid thoracic This is
inflammation of muscle and fascia, particularly of the fascial insertion of muscle to tendon to bone.
Digital palpation noted swelling, edema and inflammation in the following areas: left cervical, cervical, right
cervical, right cervical dorsal, upper thoracic, left cervical dorsal, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, mid
thoracic, right clavicular, right anterior shoulder, lower thoracic, right lower thoracic, right lumbar, lumbar, left
sacroiliac, left pelvic, sacral, right sacroiliac, right pelvic, right buttock, right posterior leg, right hip, left hip and
chest
Duties Under Duress: Areas of pain as a result of injuries: left cervical, cervical, right cervical, right cervical
dorsal, upper thoracic, left cervical dorsal, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, mid thoracic, right
clavicular, right anterior shoulder, lower thoracic, right lower thoracic, right lumbar, lumbar, left sacroiliac, left
pelvic, sacral, right sacroiliac, right pelvic, right buttock, right posterior leg, right hip, left hip and chest
Duties Under Duress: As a result of the injuries suffered in the crash, Jane states she has experienced
problems with fatigue and severe soreness.
Ortho Test- The Shoulder Depression test was positive on the right. With the patient lying supine, the
examiner, standing on the affected side, pushes the shoulder downward while laterally flexing the cervical spine
to the opposite shoulder. With the shoulder still stabilized, rotation of the cervical spine to the opposite side
follows the lateral flexion. Radicular pain, produced or aggravated by the first maneuver and confirmed by the
second reveals a positive test. The significance of this test demonstrates adhesions of the dural sleeves, the
spinal nerve roots or the adjacent structures of the joint capsule on the side opposite lateral flexion.
Ortho Test- Cervical Compression test was positive on the bilateral. A Cervical Compression Test was
performed on this patient in order to localize the cervical pain. Downward pressure was applied to the top of the
head. This test was positive when it resulted in radiating spinal pain.
Ortho Test- The maximum cervical compression test was positive on the right. In this test, the patient, sitting
upright, but attempts to laterally flex the neck and head toward the affected shoulder. The test maybe repeated
passively if there is no response when the patient does the action actively. The test is positive in the action

causes radicular pain on the side of the flexion and rotation. A positive test reveals cervical nerve root
compression.
Ortho Test-Kemp's Test was positive on the bilateral. With the patient standing, the examiner stands behind
the patient with one hand anchoring the pelvis and sacrum and the other hand he grasps the opposite shoulder;
holding the pelvis, the shoulder is firmly forced obliquely backward, downward and medialward. Low back pain
radiating into the lower extremity indicates a positive test. A positive test is indicative of a disk protrusion or
prolapse.
Ortho Test- -Lasegue's test was positive bilateral at 25%. This test is done with the patient supine and with the
knee in extension. The examiner actively flexes each thigh slowly while holding the other hand on the knee to
prevent its flexion. The leg is lifted 90° or until pain prevents further motion. The final angle of flexion at which
pain occurs, as well as the location and the intensity of the pain is noted by the examiner. The test is considered
positive when the straight leg raise cannot be raised to 90 without pain.
Apley's Scratch Test performed - Patient indicated increased pain in the shoulder joint during the ortho test
that was moderate on the right.
Assessment:
I am recommending that Jane take a period of 1 week off from work due to the injuries sustained in
a motor vehicle accident. Patient is in a severe amount of pain and unable to fully uphold the daily
duties that the employer wishes.
PROGNOSIS:
As a result of the previously mentioned findings, the patient has altered soft-tissue (muscular, tendon and
ligamentous) structure in that although it has healed it is less than optimal. When soft-tissues are torn the body
replaces a rather neat, organized network of a combination of yellow elastic, and dense white non-elastic
collagen fibers, with a rather haphazard array of dense white connective scar tissue. This scar tissue helps hold
bones together, but doesn't have the resiliency that the original connective tissue had. It causes a loss of range
of motion at the joint level and therefore increases the stress upon that joint. The joints above and below that
joint are also stressed to a greater degree since they must compensate for the loss of motion of the injured
joint. Muscular splinting is a term given to muscles which have gone into spasm to act as a restrictive agent,
like a natural cast. This natural cast is formed to restrict motion of the spine and to protect the spine from further
injury. Chronic muscular splinting or spasms may lead to chronic myofibrositis and related states of pain.
ASSESSMENT:
Based on an assessment of Jane's history, along with her subjective complaints, objective findings, and
other test results, it is evident from a standpoint of medical certainty, that her current condition DID result from
the injuries described in this report. She reported suffering varying degrees of losses of functional capacity with
the following activities: turning of the head and looking down, changing positions, sleeping, concentrating,
sitting, getting comfortable, difficulty getting out of bed, lifting, reaching, twisting and turning.
DIAGNOSIS:
Upon consideration of the information available I have diagnosed Jane Doe with: (V89.2XXA) Car
driver injured in collision, (G47.8) Difficulty Sleeping (Post-Traumatic), (G44.319) Acute post-traumatic
headache, not intractable, (S00.00XA) Superficial Injury to Head (whiplash, headrest), (M54.12) Radiculopathy,

Plan:
In order to determine a guideline for the number and duration of treatment of her injuries suffered as a result of
the automobile accident, the Croft Guidelines for treatment of CAD injuries was utilized.
In 1993, Arthur Croft, DC, MS, MPH, FACO, FACFE, published a set of management guidelines in the ACA
journal. These guidelines have also been published in Whiplash Injuries: The Cervical
Acceleration/Deceleration Syndrome, second edition, in 1995 and in a recent Canadian practitioners guide to
Whiplash Injuries, sanctioned by the Canadian Chiropractic Association.
The Croft Guidelines have been utilized for decades and widely accepted as a tool to determine treatment
outcome including number of visits. No competing guidelines relative to CAD treatment have been published
during this time, with the exception of the Québec task force guidelines on WAD, but these are only applicable
for patients who remain on disability. Several American State Chiropractic organizations and associations, as
well as in at least one Canadian province, have now adopted the Croft guidelines.
The following is a summary of the Croft guidelines for the treatment of CAD injuries.
Grades of Severity of Injury:
Grade 1 Minimal; No limitation of motion; No ligamentous injury; No neurological findings.
Grade 2 -- Slight; Limitation of motion; No ligamentous injury; No neurological findings.
Grade 3 -- Moderate; Limitation of motion; Some ligamentous injury; Neurological findings may be present.
Grade 4 -- Moderate to Severe; Limitation of motion; Ligamentous instability; Neurological findings present;
fracture or disc derangement.
Grade 5 -- Severe; Requires surgical management/stabilization.

Jane experienced a Grade 3 severity of injury. Treatment will be similar to the guidelines listed above.
Based on clinical information and her history, it is medically necessary for Jane to undergo a 24 visit
intensive care plan that includes chiropractic manipulation, manual therapy, neuromuscular re-education and
therapeutic exercises and therapeutic modalities. Re-examinations will occur every 8 visits or 1 month.

Patient will enter Phase 1 of care:
The acute inflammatory stage is the first of three phases of healing. This stage can last between 46-72 hours
with associated swelling, redness, warmth and pain. During the acute phase of care we recommend seeing her
1 time per day for 8 days to administer chiropractic treatment as per observations and findings.
Phase 1 Goals:
decrease swelling and edema
decrease pain
break up scar tissue and fibrous adhesions
decrease muscle spasms
increase active range of motion
increase passive range of motion
restore biomechanical integrity
prevent re-injury
Specific spinal adjustments will be performed on 3 to 4 regions to improve the function of the segments of the
spine that were fixated.
An adjustment of the Shoulder on the right was delivered to improve range of motion and function of joint(s).
An adjustment of the Hip on the bilateral was delivered to improve range of motion and function of joint(s).
Electrical stimulation in the form of pre-modulated current was applied to cervical dorsal, shoulder and thoracic.
The cycle time will be set at continuous. The beat frequency will be set at 80-150 Hz. This procedure will be
performed for 8 minutes in order to decrease pain, muscle spasms and inflammation. Deeper penetration of the
tissues is a feature of electrical therapy aiding in accelerated healing of deeper soft tissues.
Moist heat will be applied to relax the musculature and increase the movement of the involved areas. This moist
heat will be placed in a towel over the affected area for 8 minutes.

Subjective:
Jane presented for treatment today, complaining of frequent (50%-75%) sharp pain, shooting and diffuse
discomfort in the back of the neck, upper back, chest, mid back, low back, right shoulder both hips, right leg and
frequent headaches. She rated the intensity of discomfort, using a VAS, as a level 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 with
10 being the most severe. The discomfort was reported to increase with movement, applied pressure,
prolonged sitting and coughing/sneezing.
Objective:
Daily Objective Findings:
- Spinal Restriction(s)/Subluxation(s): occiput, C1, right C2, right C3, right C4, right C5, right C6, right C7,
right T1, right T2, T3, T4, T5, L1, L2, T12, right pelvis, right sacrum, right L5, right L4 and right L3
- Extraspinal Restrictions/Subluxations: right shoulder, right hip and left hip.
-
Pain/Tenderness: upper to mid cervical, mid to lower cervical, cervico-thoracic, thoraco-lumbar, upper
lumbar, lower lumbar and shoulder
- Postural Analysis: high right shoulder and head rotation right.
- Muscle Spasm(s): moderate muscle spasms in the following areas; left cervical, cervical, right cervical,
right cervical dorsal, upper thoracic, left cervical dorsal, right posterior shoulder, right mid thoracic, mid thoracic,
right clavicular, right anterior shoulder, lower thoracic, right lower thoracic, right lumbar, lumbar, left sacroiliac,
left pelvic, sacral, right sacroiliac, right pelvic, right buttock, right posterior leg, right hip, left hip, chest and

ASSESSMENT:
Based on an assessment of Jane's history, along with her subjective complaints, objective findings, and
other test results, it is evident from a standpoint of medical certainty, that her current condition DID result from
the injuries described in this report. She reported suffering varying degrees of losses of functional capacity with
the following activities: turning of the head and looking down, changing positions, sleeping, sitting, getting
comfortable, difficulty getting out of bed, lifting, reaching, twisting and turning.
DIAGNOSIS:

Plan:
Specific spinal adjustments will be performed on 3 to 4 regions to improve the function of the segments of the
spine that were fixated.
An adjustment of the Shoulder on the right was delivered to improve range of motion and function of joint(s).
An adjustment of the Hip on the bilateral was delivered to improve range of motion and function of joint(s).
Electrical stimulation in the form of pre-modulated current was applied to cervical dorsal, shoulder and thoracic.
The cycle time will be set at continuous. The beat frequency will be set at 80-150 Hz. This procedure will be
performed for 8 minutes in order to decrease pain, muscle spasms and inflammation. Deeper penetration of the
tissues is a feature of electrical therapy aiding in accelerated healing of deeper soft tissues.
Moist heat will be applied to relax the musculature and increase the movement of the involved areas. This moist
heat will be placed in a towel over the affected area for 8 minutes.
Mechanical traction will be implemented to increase mobility, increase the circulation and decompress the
tissues in the involved areas for 12 minutes. Also, to help restore vertebral joint motion, relieve muscle spasms
and stretch fibrotic tissue and break up adhesions in muscle tissue.

Based on an assessment of Jane's history, along with her subjective complaints, objective findings, and
other test results, it is evident from a standpoint of medical certainty, that her current condition DID result from
the injuries described in this report. She reported suffering varying degrees of losses of functional capacity with
the following activities: turning of the head and looking down, sitting, difficulty getting out of bed, lifting,
reaching, twisting and turning.
DIAGNOSIS:
Upon consideration of the information available I have diagnosed Jane Doe with: (V89.2XXA) Car
driver injured in collision, (G47.8) Difficulty Sleeping (Post-Traumatic), (G44.319) Acute post-traumatic
headache, not intractable, (S00.00XA) Superficial Injury to Head (whiplash, headrest), (M54.12) Radiculopathy,
cervical reg, (M50.121) Cervical disc disorder at C4-C5 level with radiculopathy, (M50.12 Cervical disc
disorder at C5-C6 level with radiculopathy, (M50.123) Cervical disc disorder at C6-C7 level with radiculopathy,
(S13.4XXA) Sprain of ligaments of cervical spine, initial encounter, (S16.1XXA) Strain of muscle, fascia and
tendon at neck level, init, (S23.3XXA) Sprain of ligaments of thoracic spine, initial encounter, (S29.012S) Strain
of muscle and tendon of back wall of thorax, sequela, (M54.14) Radiculopathy, thoracic reg, (M54.6) Pain in
thoracic spine, (M62.830) Muscle spasm of back, (S33.5XXA) Sprain of ligaments of lumbar spine, initial
encounter, (S39.012A) Strain of lower back, (M54.17) Radiculopathy, lumbosacral reg, (M54.41) Lumbago w/
sciatica, RT side, (M79.2) Neuralgia and neuritis, unspecified, (M60.9) Myositis, unspecified, (M25.611)
Stiffness of RT shoulder, NEC, (M25.511) Pain in RT shoulder, (S43.401A) unspec. sprain of RT shoulder joint,

visits, we will consider referring her for a Cervical spine MRI to rule out or confirm our diagnosis due to the
radicular symptoms the patient is experiencing.
Specific spinal adjustments will be performed on 3 to 4 regions to improve the function of the segments of the
spine that were fixated.
An adjustment of the Shoulder on the right was delivered to improve range of motion and function of joint(s).
An adjustment of the Hip on the right was delivered to improve range of motion and function of joint(s).
Electrical stimulation in the form of pre-modulated current was applied to cervical dorsal, shoulder and thoracic.
The cycle time will be set at continuous. The beat frequency will be set at 80-150 Hz. This procedure will be
performed for 8 minutes in order to decrease pain, muscle spasms and inflammation. Deeper penetration of the
tissues is a feature of electrical therapy aiding in accelerated healing of deeper soft tissues.
Moist heat will be applied to relax the musculature and increase the movement of the involved areas. This moist
heat will be placed in a towel over the affected area for 8 minutes.
Mechanical traction will be implemented to increase mobility, increase the circulation and decompress the
tissues in the involved areas for 12 minutes. Also, to help restore vertebral joint motion, relieve muscle spasms
and stretch fibrotic tissue and break up adhesions in muscle tissue.
